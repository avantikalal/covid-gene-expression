              a crucial role in adaptive immunity and is thus relevant in many
              biomedical applications. While next-generation sequencing data
              are often available for a patient, deducing the HLA genotype is
              difficult because of substantial sequence similarity within the
              cluster and exceptionally high variability of the loci.
              Established approaches, therefore, rely on specific HLA
              enrichment and sequencing techniques, coming at an additional
              cost and extra turnaround time. RESULT: We present OptiType, a
              novel HLA genotyping algorithm based on integer linear
              programming, capable of producing accurate predictions from NGS
              data not specifically enriched for the HLA cluster. We also
              present a comprehensive benchmark dataset consisting of RNA,
              exome and whole-genome sequencing data. OptiType significantly
              outperformed previously published in silico approaches with an
              overall accuracy of 97\% enabling its use in a broad range of

              system required for the development of secondary lymphoid
              tissues; however, knowledge of the target genes activated by
              these signaling pathways is limited. Target genes regulated by
              the LT alpha beta-LT beta R pathway include the tissue-organizing
              chemokines, CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21, which establish cytokine

              Regulation of autoimmune regulator in the thymus via LT beta R

              Dysregulated expression of LIGHT overrides peripheral tolerance

              TNF/LT/LIGHT pathways as an intervention in controlling
              autoimmune diseases is attractive, but such therapy may have

              key component of the communication system that controls the

              the Herpesvirus Entry Mediator (HVEM) and the Lymphotoxin-beta
              Receptor and is inhibited by soluble decoy receptor-3. The
              LIGHT-HVEM pathway is an important cosignaling pathway for
              T-Cells, whereas LIGHT-LTbetaR modifies the functions of
              dendritic cells and stromal cells by creating tissue
              microenvironments, which promote immune responses. HVEM also
              binds an Ig superfamily member, B and T lymphocyte attenuator

              workers were infected. In an effort to establish a screening
              program for high risk personal, the distribution of HLA class I
              and II alleles in case and control groups was examined for the
              presence of an association to a genetic susceptibly or resistance
              to SARS coronavirus infection. METHODS: HLA-class I and II allele
              typing by PCR-SSOP was performed on 37 cases of probable SARS, 28
              fever patients excluded later as probable SARS, and 101
              non-infected health care workers who were exposed or possibly
              exposed to SARS coronavirus. An additional control set of 190
              normal healthy unrelated Taiwanese was also used in the analysis.
              RESULTS: Woolf and Haldane Odds ratio (OR) and corrected P-value
              (Pc) obtained from two tails Fisher exact test were used to show
              susceptibility of HLA class I or class II alleles with
              coronavirus infection. At first, when analyzing infected SARS
              patients and high risk health care workers groups, HLA-B*4601 (OR
              = 2.08, P = 0.04, Pc = n.s.) and HLA-B*5401 (OR = 5.44, P = 0.02,
              Pc = n.s.) appeared as the most probable elements that may be
              favoring SARS coronavirus infection. After selecting only a
              ``severe cases'' patient group from the infected ``probable
              SARS'' patient group and comparing them with the high risk health
              care workers group, the severity of SARS was shown to be
              significantly associated with HLA-B*4601 (P = 0.0008 or Pc =
              0.0279). CONCLUSIONS: Densely populated regions with genetically
              related southern Asian populations appear to be more affected by
              the spreading of SARS infection. Up until recently, no probable
              SARS patients were reported among Taiwan indigenous peoples who
              are genetically distinct from the Taiwanese general population,
              have no HLA-B* 4601 and have high frequency of HLA-B* 1301. While
              increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the
              ``Probable SARS infected'' patient group, a further significant
              increase of the allele was seen in the ``Severe cases'' patient
              group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B*
              4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations.

              environment, and therefore, must be equipped to respond to and
              eliminate pathogens. Viral clearance and resolution of infection
              requires a complex, multi-faceted response initiated by resident
              respiratory tract cells and innate immune cells and ultimately
              resolved by adaptive immune cells. Although an effective immune
              response to eliminate viral pathogens is essential, a prolonged
              or exaggerated response can damage the respiratory tract.
              Immune-mediated pulmonary damage is manifested clinically in a
              variety of ways depending on location and extent of injury. Thus,
              the antiviral immune response represents a balancing act between

              vaccine, and treatment remains symptomatic. We analyzed whole
              blood transcriptional profiles to characterize the global host
              immune response to acute RSV LRTI in infants, to characterize its
              specificity compared with influenza and human rhinovirus (HRV)
              LRTI, and to identify biomarkers that can objectively assess RSV
              disease severity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a prospective
              observational study over six respiratory seasons including a
              cohort of infants hospitalized with RSV (n = 135), HRV (n = 30),
              and influenza (n = 16) LRTI, and healthy age- and sex-matched
              controls (n = 39). A specific RSV transcriptional profile was
              identified in whole blood (training cohort, n = 45 infants;
              Dallas, Texas, US) and validated in three different cohorts (test
              cohort, n = 46, Dallas, Texas, US; validation cohort A, n = 16,
              Turku, Finland; validation cohort B, n = 28, Columbus, Ohio, US)
              with high sensitivity (94\% [95\% CI 87\%-98\%]) and specificity
              (98\% [95\% CI 88\%-99\%]). It classified infants with RSV LRTI
              versus HRV or influenza LRTI with 95\% accuracy. The immune
              dysregulation induced by RSV (overexpression of neutrophil,
              inflammation, and interferon genes, and suppression of T and B
              cell genes) persisted beyond the acute disease, and immune
              dysregulation was greatly impaired in younger infants (<6 mo). We
              identified a genomic score that significantly correlated with
              outcomes of care including a clinical disease severity score and,
              more importantly, length of hospitalization and duration of
              supplemental O2. CONCLUSIONS: Blood RNA profiles of infants with
              RSV LRTI allow specific diagnosis, better understanding of
              disease pathogenesis, and assessment of disease severity. This
              study opens new avenues for biomarker discovery and

              It is postulated that the C-terminal region of pro-IL-16 is
              cleaved, releasing bioactive IL-16. To characterize IL-16
              cleavage, we transfected COS cells with a cDNA encoding a
              approximately 50-kDa form of pro-IL-16. Transfected COS cells
              released a approximately 20-kDa IL-16 cleavage product shown to
              consist of the 121 C-terminal residues of pro-IL-16 by
              immunoblotting and amino acid sequencing. Cleaved IL-16, but not
              pro-IL-16, exhibited lymphocyte chemoattractant activity. A
              C-terminal approximately 20-kDa IL-16 polypeptide was also
              released when pro-IL-16 was treated with concanavalin

              Using recombinant caspases and granzyme B, we determined that
              pro-IL-16 cleavage is mediated only by caspase-3. Relevance to
              pro-IL-16 processing in primary lymphocytes was supported by
              identifying the p20 subunit of activated caspase-3 in stimulated
              CD8(+) lymphocytes and by inhibition of CD8(+) lymphocyte
              lysate-mediated cleavage with Ac-DEVD-CHO. Pro-IL-16 is a

              the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of

              role in basic virus replication or virus assembly, many of the
              coronavirus proteins expressed in the infected cell contribute to

              gammaretrovirus that is classified into several receptor
              interference groups, including a novel FeLV-subgroup D (FeLV-D)
              that we recently identified. FeLV-D is generated by transduction

              domestic cat (ERV-DCs) into FeLV. Some ERV-DCs are replication

              report here the determination of new viral receptor interference
              groups and the discovery of a soluble antiretroviral factor,
              termed Refrex-1. Detailed analysis of FeLV-D strains and ERV-DCs

              other FeLV subgroups, and Refrex-1 specifically inhibited one of
              them. Refrex-1 is characterized as a truncated envelope protein

              which is a putative receptor-binding domain, but lacks the
              transmembrane region. Refrex-1 is efficiently secreted from the
              cells and appears to cause receptor interference extracellularly.
              Two variants of Refrex-1 encoded by provirus loci, ERV-DC7 and
              DC16, are expressed in a broad range of feline tissues. The host

              novel ERV-related viruses in cats. Refrex-1 may have been

              respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) emerged in China
              and has spread globally, creating a pandemic. Information about
              the clinical characteristics of infected patients who require
              intensive care is limited. Objective: To characterize patients
              with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring treatment in
              an intensive care unit (ICU) in the Lombardy region of Italy.
              Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective case series of
              1591 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
              referred for ICU admission to the coordinator center (Fondazione
              IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) of
              the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network and treated at one of the ICUs
              of the 72 hospitals in this network between February 20 and March
              18, 2020. Date of final follow-up was March 25, 2020. Exposures:
              SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse
              transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal
              and pharyngeal swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic and
              clinical data were collected, including data on clinical
              management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality. Data were
              recorded by the coordinator center on an electronic worksheet
              during telephone calls by the staff of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU
              Network. Results: Of the 1591 patients included in the study, the
              median (IQR) age was 63 (56-70) years and 1304 (82\%) were male.
              Of the 1043 patients with available data, 709 (68\%) had at least
              1 comorbidity and 509 (49\%) had hypertension. Among 1300
              patients with available respiratory support data, 1287 (99\%
              [95\% CI, 98\%-99\%]) needed respiratory support, including 1150
              (88\% [95\% CI, 87\%-90\%]) who received mechanical ventilation
              and 137 (11\% [95\% CI, 9\%-12\%]) who received noninvasive
              ventilation. The median positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
              was 14 (IQR, 12-16) cm H2O, and Fio2 was greater than 50\% in
              89\% of patients. The median Pao2/Fio2 was 160 (IQR, 114-220).
              The median PEEP level was not different between younger patients
              (n = 503 aged $\leq$63 years) and older patients (n = 514 aged
              $\geq$64 years) (14 [IQR, 12-15] vs 14 [IQR, 12-16] cm H2O,
              respectively; median difference, 0 [95\% CI, 0-0]; P = .94).
              Median Fio2 was lower in younger patients: 60\% (IQR, 50\%-80\%)
              vs 70\% (IQR, 50\%-80\%) (median difference, -10\% [95\% CI,
              -14\% to 6\%]; P = .006), and median Pao2/Fio2 was higher in
              younger patients: 163.5 (IQR, 120-230) vs 156 (IQR, 110-205)
              (median difference, 7 [95\% CI, -8 to 22]; P = .02). Patients
              with hypertension (n = 509) were older than those without
              hypertension (n = 526) (median [IQR] age, 66 years [60-72] vs 62
              years [54-68]; P < .001) and had lower Pao2/Fio2 (median [IQR],
              146 [105-214] vs 173 [120-222]; median difference, -27 [95\% CI,
              -42 to -12]; P = .005). Among the 1581 patients with ICU
              disposition data available as of March 25, 2020, 920 patients
              (58\% [95\% CI, 56\%-61\%]) were still in the ICU, 256 (16\%
              [95\% CI, 14\%-18\%]) were discharged from the ICU, and 405 (26\%
              [95\% CI, 23\%-28\%]) had died in the ICU. Older patients (n =
              786; age $\geq$64 years) had higher mortality than younger
              patients (n = 795; age $\leq$63 years) (36\% vs 15\%; difference,
              21\% [95\% CI, 17\%-26\%]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance:
              In this case series of critically ill patients with
              laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Lombardy,
              Italy, the majority were older men, a large proportion required
              mechanical ventilation and high levels of PEEP, and ICU mortality
              was 26\%.",

              gene expression is one of the key current challenges in molecular
              biology. Although gene expression and chromatin state dynamics
              are ultimately encoded by constellations of binding sites
              recognized by regulators such as transcriptions factors (TFs) and
              microRNAs (miRNAs), our understanding of this regulatory code and
              its context-dependent read-out remains very limited. Given that
              there are thousands of potential regulators in mammals, it is not
              practical to use direct experimentation to identify which of
              these play a key role for a particular system of interest. We
              developed a methodology that models gene expression or chromatin
              modifications in terms of genome-wide predictions of regulatory
              sites and completely automated it into a web-based tool called
              ISMARA (Integrated System for Motif Activity Response Analysis).
              Given only gene expression or chromatin state data across a set
              of samples as input, ISMARA identifies the key TFs and miRNAs
              driving expression/chromatin changes and makes detailed
              predictions regarding their regulatory roles. These include
              predicted activities of the regulators across the samples, their
              genome-wide targets, enriched gene categories among the targets,
              and direct interactions between the regulators. Applying ISMARA
              to data sets from well-studied systems, we show that it
              consistently identifies known key regulators ab initio. We also

              interactions in innate immunity, a master regulator of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE)
              during the late stages of epidermal differentiation is essential
              for epidermal barrier function and protects the body against
              environmental attack and water loss. Formation of the CE involves
              the replacement of the plasma membrane by cross-linkage of
              precursor proteins such as involucrin, small proline rich
              proteins (SPRR) and loricrin. In normal epidermis, SPRR1 is
              restricted to appendages, SPRR2 is also expressed in
              interfollicular areas, while SPRR3 is completely absent; the
              latter is most abundant in oral epithelium. This differential
              expression indicates an important part for SPRRs in specific
              barrier requirements, and reflects their importance in the
              biomechanical properties of the CE. OBJECTIVES: We report here on
              the expression of SPRR1, SPRR2 and SPRR3 in a wide range of
              cutaneous neoplastic and inflammatory diseases. METHODS: We used
              immunohistochemistry; in addition, Northern blot analysis of
              malignant tumours was performed. RESULTS: Increased suprabasal
              expression of SPRR1 and SPRR2, but no SPRR3 expression, was noted
              in inflammatory dermatoses with orthokeratotic and parakeratotic
              squamous differentiation. By contrast, differentiating epidermal
              tumours such as Bowen's disease, keratoacanthoma and squamous
              cell carcinoma expressed SPRR3. CONCLUSIONS: As SPRRs were
              originally cloned on the basis of their expression in ultraviolet
              light-irradiated keratinocytes, the expression of SPRR3 in
              actinic lesions is of interest, and might serve as a diagnostic

              was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus
              (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory,
              and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical
              outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected
              2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We
              prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with
              laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and
              next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised
              data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe
              Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from
              electronic medical records. Researchers also directly

              between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit
              (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41
              admitted hospital patients had been identified as having
              laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected
              patients were men (30 [73\%] of 41); less than half had
              underlying diseases (13 [32\%]), including diabetes (eight
              [20\%]), hypertension (six [15\%]), and cardiovascular disease
              (six [15\%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27
              (66\%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.
              One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness
              were fever (40 [98\%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76\%]), and
              myalgia or fatigue (18 [44\%]); less common symptoms were sputum
              production (11 [28\%] of 39), headache (three [8\%] of 38),
              haemoptysis (two [5\%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3\%] of 38).
              Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55\%) of 40 patients (median time from
              illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63\%) of
              41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with
              abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute
              respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29\%]), RNAaemia (six [15\%]),
              acute cardiac injury (five [12\%]) and secondary infection (four
              [10\%]). 13 (32\%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six
              (15\%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had
              higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A,
              and TNF$\alpha$. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused
              clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute
              respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU
              admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the
              origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and
              clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

              permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to
              inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show
              that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments
              on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model
              organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed
              based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from
              the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An
              efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene
              correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to
              control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene
              correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine
              differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows

              problem in respiratory medicine. From July 2015 to July 2016
              almost 300 indexed articles were published on ARDS. This review
              summarises only eight of them as an arbitrary overview of
              clinical relevance: definition and epidemiology, risk factors,
              prevention and treatment. A strict application of definition
              criteria is crucial, but the diverse resource-setting scenarios
              foster geographic variability and contrasting outcome data. A
              large international multicentre prospective cohort study
              including 50 countries across five continents reported that ARDS
              is underdiagnosed, and there is potential for improvement in its
              management. Furthermore, epidemiological data from low-income
              countries suggest that a revision of the current definition of
              ARDS is needed in order to improve its recognition and global

              factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) have been identified,
              including decoy receptor 1 (DcR1), decoy receptor 2 (DcR2), and
              decoy receptor 3 (DcR3). One of the tumor necrosis factor
              superfamily (TNFSF) members, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
              ligand (TRAIL), binds to DcR1 and DcR2, which are membranous
              receptors with a truncated cytoplasmic domain, thus unable to
              transduce TRAIL-mediated signaling. In contrast to DcR1 and DcR2,
              DcR3 is a soluble receptor capable of neutralizing the biological
              effects of three other TNFSF members: Fas ligand
              (FasL/TNFSF6/CD95L), LIGHT (TNFSF14) and TNF-like molecule 1A
              (TL1A/TNFSF15). Since FasL is a potent apoptosis- and
              inflammation-inducing factor, LIGHT is involved in apoptosis and
              inflammation, and TL1A is a T cell costimulator and is involved
              in gut inflammation, DcR3 can be defined as an immunomodulator on
              the basis of its neutralizing effects on FasL, LIGHT, and TL1A.
              Initial studies demonstrated that DcR3 expression is elevated in
              tumors cells; however, later work showed that DcR3 expression is
              also upregulated in inflammatory diseases, where serum DcR3
              levels correlate with disease progression. In addition to its
              neutralizing effect, DcR3 also acts as an effector molecule to
              modulate cell function via 'non-decoy' activities. This review
              focuses on the immunomodulatory effects of DcR3 via 'decoy' and
              'non-decoy' functions, and discusses the potential of DcR3 as a
              biomarker to predict cancer invasion and inflammation
              progression. We also discuss the possible utility of recombinant
              DcR3 as a therapeutic agent to control autoimmune diseases, as
              well as the potential to attenuate tumor progression by
              inhibiting DcR3 expression.",

              pathophysiological hallmark of DHF and DSS is plasma leakage that
              leads to enhanced vascular permeability, likely due to a cytokine
              storm. METHODS: Ninety patients with dengue during 2010-2012 in
              Singapore were prospectively recruited and stratified according
              to their disease phase, primary and secondary infection status,
              and disease severity, measured by plasma leakage. Clinical

              associated with oncogenesis and neurodegeneration. Recently, the
              role of FUS in neurodegeneration has been extensively studied,
              because mutations in FUS are associated with amyotrophic lateral
              sclerosis (ALS), and the FUS protein has been identified as a
              major component of intracellular inclusions in neurodegenerative
              disorders including ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
              FUS is a key molecule in transcriptional regulation and RNA
              processing including processes such as pre-messenger RNA (mRNA)
              splicing and polyadenylation. Interaction of FUS with various
              components of the transcription machinery, spliceosome, and the
              3'-end processing machinery has been identified. Furthermore,
              recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomic profiling
              approaches have enabled us to determine the mechanisms of
              FUS-dependent RNA processing networks at a cellular level. These
              analyses have revealed that depletion of FUS in neuronal cells
              affects alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation of
              thousands of mRNAs. Gene ontology analysis has suggested that
              FUS-modulated genes are implicated in neuronal functions and
              development. CLIP-seq of FUS has shown that FUS is frequently

              of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) has demonstrated that an

              SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses.
              However, treatment options and a cellular understanding of

              established a human cell culture model for infection with

              counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different

              package for examining differential expression of replicated count
              data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both
              biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are
              used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts,
              improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be
              used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided
              at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.

              abnormalities, while the epidermis has not yet been studied.
              OBJECTIVES: To identify differences within the epidermis of
              mature keloid scars compared with normal skin and mature
              normotrophic and hypertrophic scars. METHODS: Rete ridge
              formation and epidermal thickness were evaluated in tissue
              sections. Epidermal proliferation was assessed using
              immunohistochemistry (Ki67, keratins 6, 16 and 17) and with an in
              vitro proliferation assay. Epidermal differentiation was
              evaluated using immunohistochemistry (keratin 10, involucrin,
              loricrin, filaggrin, SPRR2, SKALP), reverse-transcriptase
              polymerase chain reaction (involucrin) and transmission electron
              microscopy (stratum corneum). RESULTS: All scars showed
              flattening of the epidermis. A trend of increasing epidermal
              thickness correlating to increasing scar abnormality was observed
              when comparing normal skin, normotrophic scars, hypertrophic
              scars and keloids. No difference in epidermal proliferation was
              observed. Only the early differentiation marker involucrin showed
              abnormal expression in scars. Involucrin was restricted to the
              granular layer in healthy skin, but showed panepidermal
              expression in keloids. Normotrophic scars expressed involucrin in
              the granular and upper spinous layers, while hypertrophic scars
              resembled normotrophic scars or keloids. Abnormal differentiation
              was associated with ultrastructural disorganization of the
              stratum corneum in keloids compared with normal skin.
              CONCLUSIONS: Keloids showed increased epidermal thickness
              compared with normal skin and normotrophic and hypertrophic
              scars. This was not due to hyperproliferation, but possibly
              caused by abnormal early terminal differentiation, which affects
              stratum corneum formation. Our findings indicate that the
              epidermis is associated with keloid pathogenesis and identify
              involucrin as a potential diagnostic marker for abnormal

              entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between

              infection associated acute lung injury (ALI). METHODS:
              Retrospective case-control study involving healthy individuals
              (controls) and patients (cases) with infection-associated ALI.
              Two hundred fifty-eight healthy normal controls and 251 patients
              with infection-associated ALI were used for comparison. The IL-32
              promoter/gene was sequenced in 52 healthy Caucasian individuals
              to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Allelic
              discrimination was performed on 11 SNPs to determine differences
              between cases and controls and outcomes in patients with
              infection associated ALI. RESULTS: Logistic and normal regression
              models were used to evaluate the associations with SNPs in cases
              and controls, and outcomes in patients with infection associated
              ALI. rs12934561, an intronic SNP, was found to be associated with
              risk for ALI in the case-control study and with more severe
              clinical course, as shown by increased time on the ventilator and
              the presence of fluid unresponsive hypotension. Further, it was
              found that rs12934561 has gender-specific effects and strongly
              interacts with other SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: A common IL-32 genotype,
              rs12934561, is associated with the risk of ALI as well as the
              need for prolonged mechanical ventilatory support. This finding
              suggests that IL-32 is not only involved in the initiating
              inflammatory and cellular events that result in ALI, but also
              participates in determining the severity of pulmonary dysfunction
              associated with ALI.",

              Linkage analysis in [AcB55 x A/J] F2 mice detected a second locus
              (Char9; logarithm of odds = 4.74) that regulates the blood-stage
              replication of Plasmodium chabaudi AS independently of Pklr. We
              characterized the 77 genes of the Char9 locus for tissue-specific
              expression, strain-specific alterations in gene expression, and
              polymorphic variants that are possibly associated with
              differential susceptibility. We identified Vnn1/Vnn3 as the
              likely candidates responsible for Char9. Vnn3/Vnn1 map within a
              conserved haplotype block and show expression levels that are
              strictly cis-regulated by this haplotype. The absence of Vnn

              activity in tissues are associated with susceptibility to malaria
              and are linked to a complex rearrangement in the Vnn3 promoter
              region. The A/J strain also carries a unique nonsense mutation
              that leads to a truncated protein. Vanin genes code for a
              pantetheinase involved in the production of cysteamine, a key
              regulator of host responses to inflammatory stimuli.

              susceptibility to malaria in A/J mice, as measured by reduced

  abstract = "There are many instances in genomics data analyses where
              measurements are made on a multivariate response. For example,
              alternative splicing can lead to multiple expressed isoforms from
              the same primary transcript. There are situations where
              differences (e.g. between normal and disease state) in the
              relative ratio of expressed isoforms may have significant
              phenotypic consequences or lead to prognostic capabilities.
              Similarly, knowledge of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
              that affect splicing, so-called splicing quantitative trait loci
              (sQTL) will help to characterize the effects of genetic variation
              on gene expression. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has provided an
              attractive toolbox to carefully unravel alternative splicing
              outcomes and recently, fast and accurate methods for transcript
              quantification have become available. We propose a statistical
              framework based on the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution that
              can discover changes in isoform usage between conditions and SNPs
              that affect relative expression of transcripts using these
              quantifications. The Dirichlet-multinomial model naturally
              accounts for the differential gene expression without losing
              information about overall gene abundance and by joint modeling of
              isoform expression, it has the capability to account for their
              correlated nature. The main challenge in this approach is to get
              robust estimates of model parameters with limited numbers of
              replicates. We approach this by sharing information and show that
              our method improves on existing approaches in terms of standard
              statistical performance metrics. The framework is applicable to
              other multivariate scenarios, such as Poly-A-seq or where
              beta-binomial models have been applied (e.g., differential DNA

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Gene expression class comparison studies may identify
              hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed (DE)
              between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result
              of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by
              identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed
              changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on
              either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway
              (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the
              pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class
              scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple
              sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that
              these pathways are built to describe. RESULTS: We describe a
              novel signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) that combines the
              evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a
              novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on
              a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is
              used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway
              perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived
              from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment
              evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway
              significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and
              perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the
              novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these
              data show that SPIA has better specificity and more sensitivity
              than several widely used pathway analysis methods. AVAILABILITY:

              receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is
              reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney
              and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in
              the lung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as
              ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the
              potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression
              atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed
              the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus

              recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in

              plays a key role. Additionally, while multiple immune mediators
              have been shown to affect pathogenesis, a comprehensive
              understanding of disease progression is lacking. Previous work
              has demonstrated that a member of the TNF superfamily, TNFSF14
              (LIGHT), which is pro-inflammatory in several contexts,
              surprisingly plays an important role in protection from
              inflammation in mouse models of colitis, with LIGHT deficient
              mice having more severe disease pathogenesis. However, LIGHT is a
              single member of a complex signaling network. It signals through
              multiple receptors, including herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)
              and lymphotoxin beta receptor (LT$\beta$R); these two receptors
              in turn can bind to other ligands. It remains unknown which
              receptors and competing ligands can mediate or counteract the
              outcome of LIGHT-signaling during colitis. Here we demonstrate
              that LIGHT signaling through LT$\beta$R, rather than HVEM, plays
              a critical role in the progression of DSS-induced colitis, as
              LT$\beta$R deficient mice exhibit a more severe disease
              phenotype. Further, mice deficient in LT$\alpha$$\beta$ do not
              exhibit differential colitis progression compared to WT mice.
              However, deletion of both LIGHT and LT$\alpha$$\beta$, but not
              deletion of both LT$\alpha$$\beta$ and LT$\beta$R, resulted in a
              reversal of the adverse effects associated with the loss of
              LIGHT. In sum, the LIGHT/LT$\alpha$$\beta$/LT$\beta$R signaling
              network contributes to DSS colitis, but there may be additional
              receptors or indirect effects, and therefore, the relationships
              between these receptors and ligands remains enigmatic.",

              We compared the immunopathological response induced by influenza
              virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and that by A/Panama-like (H3N2) virus in

              against influenza in animal models. Enhancing alveolar macrophage
              function may contribute to protection against influenza.
              OBJECTIVES: To determine if increased expression of
              granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the
              lung increases resistance to influenza. METHODS: Wild-type mice
              and transgenic mice that expressed GM-CSF in the lung were
              infected with influenza virus, and lung pathology, weight loss,
              and mortality were measured. We also administered GM-CSF to the
              lungs of wild-type mice that were infected with influenza virus.
              MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Wild-type mice all died after
              infection with different strains of influenza virus, but all
              transgenic mice expressing GM-CSF in the lungs survived. The
              latter also had greatly reduced weight loss and lung injury, and
              showed histologic evidence of a rapid host inflammatory response
              that controlled infection. The resistance of transgenic mice to
              influenza was abrogated by elimination of alveolar phagocytes,
              but not by depletion of T cells, B cells, or neutrophils.
              Transgenic mice had far more alveolar macrophages than did
              wild-type mice, and they were more resistant to influenza-induced
              apoptosis. Delivery of intranasal GM-CSF to wild-type mice also
              conferred resistance to influenza. CONCLUSIONS: GM-CSF confers
              resistance to influenza by enhancing innate immune mechanisms
              that depend on alveolar macrophages. Pulmonary delivery of this
              cytokine has the potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is
              a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
              non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
              lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
              technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
              high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
              limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
              billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
              the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
              based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
              that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed
              suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching
              procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in
              mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2
              $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core
              server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity
              and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of
              canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and
              chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping
              full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse
              transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
              experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions
              with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of
              the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR
              is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source

              in an in vivo bleomycin model of lung fibrosis, that CO
              suppresses alpha-smooth muscle actin expression and enhances
              small proline-rich protein-1a expression. We further show that
              these effects of CO depend upon signaling via the extracellular
              signal-regulated kinase pathway. Our results demonstrate novel
              transcriptional targets for CO and further elucidate the
              mechanism by which CO suppresses fibrosis.",

              data is an important part of the scientific record, and
              increasing numbers of journals and funding agencies require that
              next-generation sequence data are deposited into the SRA. The SRA
              was established as a public repository for the next-generation
              sequence data and is operated by the International Nucleotide
              Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). INSDC partners include
              the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the
              European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of
              Japan (DDBJ). The SRA is accessible at

  abstract = "When small RNA is sequenced on current sequencing machines, the
              resulting reads are usually longer than the RNA and therefore
              contain parts of the 3' adapter. That adapter must be found and
              removed error-tolerantly from each read before read mapping.
              Previous solutions are either hard to use or do not offer
              required features, in particular support for color space data. As
              an easy to use alternative, we developed the command-line tool
